"""
    run_simulation!(model, vis; max_frames=MAX_FRAMES)
 
Advance the MPM simulation to `model.t_max`, recording synchronized frames
into two video streams (3D perspective and 2D slice) at a fixed framerate.
Returns the two `VideoStream`s so the caller can save them to disk.
 
Note: both Makie backends render through whichever backend is currently
active, so each backend must be re-activated immediately before its
`recordframe!` call.
